Development process
===
As most of the development is happening on my free time, that's why there is no strict process. To make a contribution,
you need to make a PR:
* it should not introduce a major structural changes (like let's rewrite everything in Java) without prior discussion
with the dev team.
* it should pass existing tests.
* if it's not a trivial fix, it should also be covered with basic tests. A general rule of thumb on writing tests is to 
cover the happy code flow. Optionally it should also cover most frequent failures.
